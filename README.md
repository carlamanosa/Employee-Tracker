# Employee-Tracker

This employee tracker application is a application that edits, views, and updates a company's database of all employees, managers, and departments. The first page will ask if you want to add, view, or update. In the add option, it will ask if you would like to add an employee, manager, or department and will prompt you to input new details depending on your choice. The view option will populate a list of the department, employee,or role you would like to view. The upate option will give you the choice to edit any existing information within the database.   

Technologies used are mySQL, node packages which include inquirer, and our local server.
